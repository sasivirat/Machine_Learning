## Description

## Machine Learning Techniques
### Linear Regression
1. **Linearity**: The relationship between the independent and dependent variables should be linear.
2. **Independence**: Observations should be independent of each other.
3. **Homoscedasticity**: The variance of the errors should be constant across all levels of the independent variables.
4. **Normality**: The errors of the model should be normally distributed.

### Logistic Regression
1. **Binary Outcome**: The dependent variable should be binary (0 or 1).
2. **Independence**: Observations should be independent of each other.
3. **No Multicollinearity**: The independent variables should not be too highly correlated with each other.
4. **Large Sample Size**: Generally, a larger sample size is required for reliable results.

### Clustering
1. **Scalability**: The algorithm should be able to handle large datasets efficiently.
2. **Ability to Handle Different Data Types**: The algorithm should work with numerical, categorical, and ordinal data.
3. **Discovery of Arbitrary Shapes**: The algorithm should be able to find clusters of any shape, not just spherical ones.
4. **Minimal Domain Knowledge**: The algorithm should require minimal input parameters from the user.
5. **Handling Noisy Data**: The algorithm should be robust to outliers and missing values.
6. **Incremental Clustering**: The algorithm should be able to update clusters with new data without starting from scratch.
